# 💯 100 Days of Code: Python Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge! 🚀  
In this journey, I'm diving deep into **Python** — one day, one step at a time. 🐍

## 📅 What is this?

Inspired by the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I'm committing to coding **every day for 100 days** — focusing on **Python** to sharpen my skills and build projects.

## 🧠 Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals
- Build real-world mini projects
- Learn libraries like `tkinter`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `flask`, etc.
- Push progress to GitHub daily 📌
