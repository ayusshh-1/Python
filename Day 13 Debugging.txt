Day 13 of 100 Days of Code

Today, I focused on learning and practicing debugging in Python. Here's a detailed explanation of what I learned:

1. range(a, b) – End is NOT included
In Python, the range() function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 'a' up to (but not including) 'b'.

Example:
for i in range(1, 5):
    print(i)

Output:
1
2
3
4

Here, 5 is not included.

2. randint(a, b) – Both ends ARE included
The randint(a, b) function from the random module returns a random integer between 'a' and 'b', including both.

Example:
import random
print(random.randint(1, 5))

This can print any number from 1 to 5.

3. List indexing starts at 0
Python lists use zero-based indexing.

Example:
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print(my_list[0])  # apple
print(my_list[1])  # banana

4. Using Python Tutor
Python Tutor (https://pythontutor.com) is a website that helps visualize Python code step-by-step. It's useful for understanding how variables change, loops execute, and functions behave.

5. Problem Solving
I applied these concepts in practice problems and got better at debugging and writing clean Python code.

It was a productive and insightful day!
