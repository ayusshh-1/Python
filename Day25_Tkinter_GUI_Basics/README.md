# Day 25 - Tkinter GUI Basics

Today I built a basic interactive GUI using Python's `tkinter` library.

## App Features
- A window titled **"Km to Mile"**
- An `Entry` widget with placeholder text
- A `Label` with default text
- A `Button` that updates the label based on user input

## How It Works
- The user enters text in the box
- When they click the button, the label updates to show what they typed

## Files
- `gui_app.py`: Main GUI code
- `Day_25_Tkinter_GUI_Summary.txt`: Summary of widgets and code examples from Day 25
